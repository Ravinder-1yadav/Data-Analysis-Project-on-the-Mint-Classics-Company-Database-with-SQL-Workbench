 Evaluation

There are warehouses with a significant product stock but generate relatively low revenue.
Some products have a high stock quantity but low sales or vice versa.
Certain product lines have substantial stock quantities but yield low revenue.
There are customers with good payments, but there are also customers with payment issues.
Some employees exhibit high sales performance, while others have lower sales performance.
6. Deployment

In deployment step, the task is to present the findings. Therefore, I will attempt to recommend some policies that the company may consider, including:

Evaluating which products should be added and which should be reduced
Promoting in the countries with the highest order rates
Adjusting product prices so that the products can be sold
Implementing policies for customers with payment issues
Recognizing employees with good performance and providing training for those with lower performance
