1. Business Understanding

On this step, we need to understand the business needs, such as goals, business planning, and strategies. The company’s objective is to optimize inventory usage to increase revenue. Additionally, the company needs to evaluate customer and employee performance to provide better service. Therefore, there are several topics or issues that we need to explore in this analysis:

What is the current state of the company’s inventory? Does the company need to add or reduce the products it currently holds?
How have the company’s sales been so far?
How much revenue has the company generated? What is the revenue generated by each product sold?
What type of customers have purchased the company’s products? What actions need to be taken with regard to the company’s customers?
How has the employee performance been so far?
